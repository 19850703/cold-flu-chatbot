# Use Case Description: Vaccine Schedule Planning and Consultation Chatbot

## Background
In Nova Scotia, understanding the vaccination schedule for infants, children, adults, and travelers can be overwhelming for residents. With different vaccines recommended at specific ages, for varying health conditions, and for travel, caregivers and individuals often have many questions.

Current information is dispersed across multiple sources like Nova Scotia Health, Health Canada, and IWK Health, which makes it difficult for users to find clear, consolidated guidance.

## User Pain Points
- **Confusion over vaccine schedules:** Parents and caregivers are often unsure about the timing and types of vaccines required for their children.
- **Lack of consolidated information:** Information is spread across various websites, making it difficult for users to get a clear answer quickly.
- **Concerns about vaccine safety:** Some users seek evidence-based information on vaccine safety, possible side effects, and how to prepare before vaccination.
- **Travel-related vaccine queries:** Travelers often need guidance on which vaccines are necessary for international trips.

## Solution
Develop a **chatbot using the Ollama + AnythingLLM stack** that:
- Retrieves local, up-to-date vaccine schedules and safety information.
- Provides quick, evidence-based responses to vaccine-related questions.
- Guides users to official health resources for further reading.
- Clearly communicates that it does not provide medical diagnoses.

## Success Criteria
1. **Accuracy:** The chatbot provides accurate, up-to-date information sourced from:
   - Nova Scotia Health
   - Health Canada
   - IWK Health Pediatric Guidelines
2. **Scope Coverage:** The chatbot can effectively respond to:
   - Vaccine schedules for all age groups
   - Safety concerns and preparation tips
   - Public health updates when available
3. **User Guidance:** The chatbot includes a disclaimer in every response to remind users that it does not provide medical advice.
4. **User Experience:** Interactions are clear, friendly, and non-technical, especially for caregivers and parents.
5. **Testing:** The chatbot correctly answers the following sample questions:
   - "What vaccines should my 2-month-old baby get?"
   - "Do I need to do anything special before getting a flu shot?"

## Ethical Considerations
- The chatbot is strictly for educational purposes.
- It does not provide medical diagnosis or personalized treatment plans.
- Users are always encouraged to consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns.
