# Vaccine Schedule Planning and Consultation
**Chatbot Scenario Package**

## Scenario Background
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, vaccination schedules can be complex for infants, children, and adults. Patients and caregivers often have questions about timing, eligibility, and safety. Nova Scotia Health, the provincial immunization program, and Health Canada publish detailed schedules and guidelines to help residents stay up to date. This scenario asks students to use the **Ollama + AnythingLLM** stack, combined with locally available, authoritative health education materials, to design a chatbot for Vaccine Schedule Planning and Consultation.

## Scenario Goals
- Help users understand recommended vaccine schedules based on age and eligibility.
- Provide evidence-based answers about safety and preparation.
- Clearly communicate that the chatbot does not provide professional medical diagnoses.
